# 4. IADD：Instantly and Automatically Deployed Deswap

Right after a token's ICO succeeds, a decentralized exchange network i.e. the IADS Network will be initiated, and meanwhile, a payment network is ready as well. But, wait for a minute, please.

NaturalDAO's decentralized and censorship-resistant mechanism creates a decentralized benchmark token\(stable coin\) NDAO with constant intrinsic value. NDAO is controlled by algorithm and smart contract, means its price is absolutely stable in the decentralized markets, including the investment market \(exchange\) and the consumer market\(payment\). This is the first time we make a stable coin that its price is really stalbe in the decentralized markets. Circulation of this stable coin can greatly push forward application of blockchain technologies in business and economy.

Thus in the IADD Network \(Instantly and Automatically Deployed  Deswap Network\) the benchmark token NDAO will be in circulation and it will eventually be adpoted in non-investment markets and people's daily life such as retail etc. This will provide a revolutionary solution for application of blockchain technologies in business and economy.  

1. Trading Market That Reflects Real Demand: when a token issuer initiates an ICO on this platform, right after the ICO succeeds his smart contract issues an additional amount of its token, equivalent to the amount for the ICO \(i.e. the total issued token amount will be twice the amount used to raise fund during the ICO period\). These additonally issued tokens will be transferred to the NSC contract's address and be used as a reserve for establishing a trading pair with NDAO. After the NSC contract receives these tokens, Imporved CPMM works and its DEX would be ready simultaneously.

   A common issue that both Bancor and Uniswap face is that there are insufficient tokens in their reserves. This leverages price vibration and results in relatively large price fluctuations when trading volumes go slightly higher. Our solution injects an ICO's full token amount into the decentralized exchange and reflects the market's real demand. Only based on this liquidity will a token's pricing be rational and reasonable.

2. When a token issuer's additionally issued tokens are transferred to the NSC address, NSC will verify the ICO's status and on-chain data. If this ICO is verified valid its exchange will open immediately at the ICO's final exchange rate.

   NSC needs to verify the following four items:

   * The token's ICO succeeds.
   * The received token amount equals the ICO's token amount.
   * The ICO token cannot be re-issued.
   * The token issuer accepts all the terms specified by NaturalDAO.

3. This mechanism has the following advantages:
   * Controled by improved CPMM and smart contract, it's impossible to sell any dAPP's token when its price is as low as the ICO issue price. The IADD Network prevents a token issuer from dumping his tokens for NDAOs right after his token listed on the exchange. There are cases in which a token issuer issues a worthless token and dumps his holding \(maybe up to 80 or 90 percent of the total token supply\) for valuable tokens such as ETH and stable coins etc right after his token is listed for trading.
   * There are cases in which right after a token is listed for trading some investors collude with the token issuer to firstly beat down the token price by dumping their holdings and then buy back at a price even lower than the ICO price. The IADD Network prevents this from happening. For instance in this system after token ABC is listed for trading if no one buys ABCs none of the existing ABC holders can sell their ABCs. This drives all investors to investigate deeply an ICO project before he makes an investment decision.
   * This mechanism prevents a token's price from dropping below its ICO price therefore protects investors\(bought the token from IADD Network\) from suffering huge losses due to price diving which often happens in all existed exchanges and could cause a token's price to lose 90% to 95% percent after that token is listed for trading.
   * The above points can be viewed as a result of regulations to an ICO.
   * Signals an alarm for a dying token/project--- In a traditional crypto exchange or decentralized exchange such as Bancor and Uniswap etc a token's price can go down infinitely. It is hard to judge whether or not a token/project's development is still on track. In the IADD Network when a token's price goes down to its ICO price its holders will no longer be able to sell it. This signals an alarm to all potential investors and existing holders that this token/project may have problems. If a token's price remains at the ICO price for a long time, e.g. 1 year or even longer, this signals an alarm that this token/project may fail.
   * Gives a "frozen" token/project some time to focuse on its development.

     There are cases in which a token/project's development is not recognized by the markets and its price is beaten down to its ICO price but its team is striving to revamp its development. In this case although the token's price is too low for its holders to sell it, its team may still have chances to save the project by delivering good service and product. Once its service and product are recognized by the markets again the token's price will go up again. And with IADD Network's help, it would be much easier to change investor perceptions of the project.
4. Like Uniswap we use a similar but improved CPMM algorithm to determine a real-time decentralized trading price for any ERC20 token that is listed and traded in the exchange. Unlike Uniswap or Bancor we use exactly the same volume of issued token as the base, and we don't use ETH or BNT whose prices in USD fluctuate hugely to form a trading pair but use a stable coin NDAO instead. In any trading pair a token is priced in the stable coin NDAO. At present, NDAO‘s price is determined by ETH's US Dollar price, means 1 NDAO is equal to 1 US Dollar. And its decimals are 18. In the future, when NaturalDAO removes all elements obtained from outside markets and determines the ETH's price by using only ICPMM, NDAO will no longer has any relationship with US Dollar, but for sure it will be a stable coin forever.

5. For any token's liquidity neither its NDAO nor its token can be swapped out of the exchange unless people sell one for the other with equivalent exchange mode. The value of a liquidity will never be less than the value of the token's ICO.

6. ETH and all tokens listed in NaturalDAO can be bought or sold freely.
